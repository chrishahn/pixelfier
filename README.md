pixelfier
=========

This was just a weekend project that has evolved slightly over the past year or so. I love the aesthetics of pixel art but am hopelessly bad at creating it by hand.

Enter this little tool which basically lowers the resolution of a picture in very deliberate ways to create the same style as genuine pixel art. You may have to fine-tune your form values to get the desired image, but overall I'm happy with how it turned out.

All of the image processing is being done with PHP's GD library. This is way low rent.
